# Radioactive-Decay-Simulation
### :one: Introduction
"Radioactive Decay Simulations" This computer graphics project shows working like Alpha blocked by paper, Beta blocked by aluminium, Gamma penetrates all. Alpha and Gamma pass aluminium, all pass through lead. Simplifying ray-object interactions in the system.


### :two: Prerequisites
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS <br>
ðŸ”¹ Hard Disk: 40GB or More. <br>
ðŸ”¹ RAM: 2GB or More. <br>
ðŸ”¹ Monitor: 1400 x 600 Display Resolution. <br>
ðŸ”¹ Operating System: Windows <br>

2.3 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS <br>
ðŸ”¹ C++ language <br>
ðŸ”¹ OpenGL <br>
ðŸ”¹ CodeBlocks <br>

### :four: Working Steps 
1) Alpha Blocked by Paper: Alpha radiation is absorbed by paper due to its low penetration power.

2) Beta Blocked by Aluminum: Beta radiation is stopped by aluminum due to its moderate penetration power.

3) Gamma Penetrates All: Gamma radiation, with high penetration power, passes through all materials.

4) Alpha and Gamma Pass Aluminum: Both alpha and gamma radiation can penetrate aluminum due to their high energy levels.

5) All Pass Through Lead: Despite its density, lead cannot stop any type of radiation; hence, all types pass through it.
